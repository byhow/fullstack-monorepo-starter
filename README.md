## Note 
This is highly opinionated and may subject to changes. The intuition behind the choices is that I wanted to keep this as stable and orthodox as possible so that I won't need to worry about compatibility issues or breaking changes. It also does not have any UI frameworks or CI in place so that it still maintains some customizability.
